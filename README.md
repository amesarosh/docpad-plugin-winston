# Winston Plugin for [DocPad](http://docpad.org)


## Install

```
docpad install winston
```

## What?

This plugin will replace the default [Caterpillar](https://github.com/bevry/caterpillar) logger in DocPad for Winston.

## Why?

As DocPad has matured, there has been a noticable increase in build times for larger sites. Replacing Caterpillar with Winston has resulted in faster builds for DocPad versions >= 6.32.0

Note that this can be seen as a temporary drop-in solution to the issue, where diagnosing Caterpillar performance issues will be more ideal.
